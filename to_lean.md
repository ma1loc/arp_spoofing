ARP spoofing attacks are often used to facilitate other attacks such as:

    - Denial-of-service attacks: DoS attacks often leverage ARP spoofing to link multiple IP addresses with a single target’s MAC address. As a result, traffic that is intended for many different IP addresses will be redirected to the target’s MAC address, overloading the target with traffic.
    
	- Session hijacking: Session hijacking attacks can use ARP spoofing to steal session IDs, granting attackers access to private systems and data.
    
	- Man-in-the-middle attacks: MITM attacks can rely on ARP spoofing to intercept and modify traffic between victims.
